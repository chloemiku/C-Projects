# Project: Speller Dictionary

The Speller Dictionary project is a C program that implements a spell-checker using a hash table for efficient word lookup. This project showcases my proficiency in hash table implementation, file handling, and efficient data structures in C.

- **Project Description**

    The Speller Dictionary project handles the following tasks:

	- Dictionary Loading: Loads a dictionary file into memory, storing words in a hash table for quick lookup.
	- Word Checking: Checks if a given word is in the dictionary using a hash function and linked lists for collision resolution.
	- Hash Function Implementation: Implements a custom hash function to distribute words uniformly across the hash table.
	- Memory Management: Manages memory allocation and deallocation for the hash table and linked lists.
	- Spell-checking: Checks the spelling of words in a text file against the loaded dictionary.


- **Features:**

	- Hash Table: Utilizes a hash table with linked lists for efficient word storage and lookup.
	- Custom Hash Function: Implements a custom hash function to ensure a uniform distribution of words.
	- Linked Lists for Collision Resolution: Uses linked lists to handle hash collisions, ensuring all words are accessible.
	- Efficient File Handling: Reads words from a dictionary file and a text file for spell-checking.
	- Memory Safety: Ensures proper memory management by freeing all allocated memory after use.

This project demonstrates my ability to implement efficient data structures, handle file I/O, and manage memory in C. It also highlights my skills in creating a practical application for spell-checking using a hash table.
