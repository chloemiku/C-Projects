# Project: Genetic Inheritance Simulation

The Genetic Inheritance Simulation project is a C program that simulates the inheritance of blood type alleles over multiple generations. This project demonstrates my ability to handle dynamic memory allocation, recursive functions, and struct-based data organization in C.

- **Project Description**

    The Genetic Inheritance Simulation project handles the following tasks:

	- Family Tree Creation: Creates a family tree with a specified number of generations, simulating the inheritance of blood type alleles from parents to children.
	- Dynamic Memory Allocation: Allocates memory for each person in the family tree and assigns parent-child relationships recursively.
	- Allele Assignment: Randomly assigns blood type alleles to individuals based on their parents’ alleles or randomly for the initial generation.
	- Family Tree Printing: Prints the family tree, showing each person’s blood type alleles and their generation level.
	- Memory Management: Ensures proper memory management by freeing all allocated memory after use.


- **Features:**

	- Recursive Family Tree Generation: Utilizes recursive functions to create a family tree with multiple generations.
	- Struct-based Data Organization: Uses structs to represent individuals and their relationships within the family tree.
	- Random Allele Assignment: Implements a random function to assign blood type alleles realistically.
	- Formatted Output: Provides a clear and formatted output of the family tree, showing each individual’s generation and blood type alleles.
	- Memory Safety: Ensures all dynamically allocated memory is properly freed to avoid memory leaks.

This project demonstrates my skills in dynamic memory management, recursion, and struct-based data organization in C. It also highlights my ability to simulate genetic inheritance and manage complex data structures.
