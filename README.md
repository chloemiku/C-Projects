## Introduction

This repository showcases various C projects that I have completed as part of my learning journey and personal interest in programming. Each project is well-documented and includes a README file explaining the purpose, usage, and features of the project. These projects highlight my ability to write clean, efficient, and well-structured code.

## Projects

### Project 1: Blood Type Inheritance Simulation
This project simulates the genetic inheritance of blood type alleles over multiple generations. It demonstrates my understanding of structs, dynamic memory allocation, and recursion in C.

- **Keywords:**
  - Recursion
  - Linked List
  - Memory Allocation

- **Features**:
  - Simulate inheritance of blood types through multiple generations.
  - Use structs to represent individuals with parents and alleles.
  - Randomly assign alleles to individuals.
  - Print the family tree showing blood types of each member.


### Project 2: Spell Checker
This project performs spell check to .txt file after loading a dictionary of words from disk into memory. In this project, I implemented a dictionary's functionality using a hash table. The program checks if a word is in the dictionary, loads words into the dictionary from a file, and unloads the dictionary from memory.

- **Keywords:**
  - Hash Table
  - Linked List
  - Memory Allocation

- **Features**:
  - Implement a hash table to store words.
  - Check for the existence of a word in the dictionary.
  - Load words from a dictionary file into the hash table.
  - Unload the dictionary from memory, ensuring no memory leaks.


 ### Project 3: JPEG Image Recovery
The JPEG Recovery program is designed to search through a raw memory card file to find and recover JPEG images. The program reads the memory card file in 512-byte blocks and identifies the start of JPEG files by checking for specific header patterns. Once a new JPEG is found, it creates a new file and continues to write the subsequent blocks until the next JPEG header is detected.

- **Keywords:**
  - File Handling
  - Memory Management
  - Error Handling

- **Features**:
  - Handle file by opening memory card file and reads content in fixed-size blocks.
  - Identifies beginning of new JPEG file.
  - Manages buffer operations to ensure smooth file reading and writing.
  - Basic error handling for file operations.

 
### Project 4: Tideman Voteman System
The Tideman Voting System project is a C program that implements the Tideman election method, also known as the ranked pairs method. This program is designed to manage ranked voting and determine the winner based on votersâ€™ preferences. It showcases my ability to handle complex data structures, sorting algorithms, and recursive functions in C.

- **Keywords:**
  - Recursion
  - Linked List
  - Sorting Algorithm

- **Description**

  The Tideman Voting System project handles the following tasks:

  - Ranked Voting Input: Accepts ranked votes from multiple voters, where each voter ranks candidates in order of preference.
  - Preference Recording: Records the number of voters who prefer one candidate over another.
  - Pair Creation: Identifies pairs of candidates where one is preferred over the other and records these pairs.
  - Pair Sorting: Sorts the pairs in decreasing order by the strength of victory.
  - Cycle Detection and Locking: Locks pairs into a directed graph in order, ensuring no cycles are formed, to determine the candidate graph.
  - Winner Determination: Determines and prints the winner of the election based on the locked graph.

- **Features**:
  - Utilizes a 2D array to record preferences between candidates.
  - Uses a struct to store pairs of candidates and dynamically creates an array of these pairs.
  - Implements a recursive function to check for cycles in the candidate graph to maintain the validity of the election.
  - Includes a sorting mechanism to order pairs by the strength of their victory.
  - Efficiently manages and validates user inputs for ranked voting.
